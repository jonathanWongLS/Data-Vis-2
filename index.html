            <h1>Air Pollution on Climate & Health</h1>
            <p>
              According to the <b>United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</b>, emissions of pollutants into the air can result in changes to the climate.
              Different components of particulate matter (e.g PM2.5) can have either warming or cooling effects on the climate.
              <br><br>
              <b>PM2.5</b> are tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated. 
              Particles in the PM2.5 size range are able to travel deeply into the respiratory tract. Exposure to fine particles can cause short-term health effects such as: 
              <ul>
                <li>Eye, Nose, Throat and Lung Irritation</li> 
                <li>coughing</li> 
                <li>sneezing</li> 
                <li>runny nose</li> 
                <li>shortness of breath</li>

            <h1>Mismanaged Plastic Waste</h1>
            <p>
              Mass production of plastics, which began just six decades ago, has accelerated so rapidly that it has created 8.3 million metric tons.
              <b>National Geographic</b> states that 6.3 billion metric tons out of the 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic created, only 9% has become plastic waste.
              The vast majority (79%) is accumulating in landfills or sloughing off in the natural environment as litter.
              <br><br>
              In the year 2010, <b>China and Indonesia</b> have the <b>highest amount of mismanaged plastic waste</b> among the other countries. However, China has a massive difference in the amount of mismanaged plastic waste compared to that of Indonesia, with about 5 billion metric tons in difference.

            <h1>Rising Sea Level</h1>
            <p>
              Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming according to NASA:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  The expansion of seawater as it warms.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              The sea level has risen by a significant volume over the previous decade, as displayed on the line chart on the right.
              Large mean sea level increases such as the average change in mean level of the South China Sea from the year 2016 to the year 2017 which recorded a 20mm rise.

            <h1>Natural Disasters</h1>
            <p>
              According to The Royal Society, a warming climate can contribute to the intensity of heat waves by increasing the chances of very hot days and nights.
              Climate warming also increases evaporation on land, which can worsen drought and create conditions more prone to wildfire and a longer wildfire season.
              <br><br>
              Data visualised, by the stacked bar chart on the right, shows a clear and large difference in the number of natural disaster events happening globally as time goes on.
              Floods have been recorded to have the largest difference in the number of occurences when compared to that of other natural disasters. The melting of ice caps in the North pole caused by climate change one of the main factors of floods.
